A basketball game built using [tiny graphics](https://github.com/encyclopedia-of-code/tiny-graphics-js)!

To run locally, navigate to the folder containing these files and run `python server.py`. The website will show up on `localhost:8000`.

You can also find the game deployed online at [tiny-basketball.netlify.app/](https://tiny-basketball.netlify.app/)

## What to expect

Upon loading the game, you will find the basketball court scene. The instruction on how to play are on a square in front of you. To start playing, you can press `q`.

Once the game has started, you have 45 seconds to score as many points as possible! 

To shoot, you can simply click in the direction you want. Once the game is over, you'll see your last score, your session's highest score, and the number of games you've played this session. 

Pressing `q` stops and restarts the game <br>
Pressing `p` pauses the movement of the backboard <br>
Pressing `t` toggles the music on and off <br>
Pressing `o` turns on overdrive mode when pressed during a game, which speeds the backboard up by 4x
